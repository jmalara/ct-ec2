# Serverless example for CT
This code deploys an sample ec2 server stack based on your requirements.  Tagging could be better and multi-region support in the CF isn't there, but you get the idea.

# Requirements
1. AWS CLI
2. Access Key and Secret key for an administrator setup in your aws credential file under the default profile

# Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. CD into the repository directory
3. Run ./create.sh
4. Wait for stack to complete and it will spit out the load balancer URL
5. Profit
